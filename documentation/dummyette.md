introduction
---

This module contains a function that analyses a chess board to find the best moves available.

`analyse(board)`
---

This function tries to find the best moves available on a given chess board. It completely fails at that, but it tries at least! It will return an array containing all valid moves for the board in order of quality, from best to worst.
